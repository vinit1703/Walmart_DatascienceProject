Walmart E-Commerce Sales Prediction Project ðŸš€
Overview
This project focuses on predicting Walmart's e-commerce sales using advanced machine learning techniques and visualizing insights with Power BI. It incorporates the full data science pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment and integration with business intelligence tools.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned and transformed raw e-commerce data.
Applied feature engineering, one-hot encoding, and feature scaling.
Performed statistical tests (ANOVA, Chi-Square) for feature selection.
Machine Learning Models:

Developed and evaluated multiple models:
Linear Regression: Baseline predictions.
Random Forest Regressor: Non-linear relationships and feature importance.
XGBoost Regressor: Optimized boosting for accurate predictions.
Metrics: Achieved high accuracy with minimal error (RÂ² > 0.99).
Model Interpretation:

Used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret model predictions and understand feature contributions.
Deployment:

Built a Flask API for real-time predictions.
Tested API endpoints using Postman for seamless integration.
Integration with Power BI:

Imported model predictions into Power BI for interactive visualizations.
Created dashboards showcasing predicted vs. actual sales, feature impact, and customer insights.
